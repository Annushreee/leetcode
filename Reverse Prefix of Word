Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.

For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
Return the resulting string.

Example 1:

Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".

SOLUTION ::
class Solution {
    public String reversePrefix(String word, char ch) {
        // Convert the string to a character array
        char[] charArray = word.toCharArray();
        
        // Find the index of the character ch
        int j = word.indexOf(ch);
        
        // If the character is found
        if (j != -1) {
            // Reverse the part of the array from index 0 to j
            int left = 0, right = j;
            while (left < right) {
                // Swap characters
                char temp = charArray[left];
                charArray[left] = charArray[right];
                charArray[right] = temp;
                left++;
                right--;
            }
        }
        
        // Convert the character array back to a string
        return new String(charArray);
    }
}
